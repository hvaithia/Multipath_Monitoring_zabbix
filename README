The scripts and zabbix templates are to do multipath monitoring in Zabbix

I have used fabric to get the output of multipath command from different hosts (host01, host02 in my script)

Modify the hostnames, User and Password in fabfile.py before using the project

These scripts must be placed in "externalscripts" directory in zabbix as defined in zabbix_server.conf

multipath.py needs to be executed by zabbix (It needs execute permissions for zabbix user at least minimally)

I run the fabfile.py multipath as a cron (This can be run from zabbix as well but I chose cron). Interval is 10 mins once

externalscripts]# crontab -l
*/10 * * * * /usr/bin/fab -f /usr/lib/zabbix/externalscripts/fabfile.py multipath

The zabbix template must be imported and attached to the zabbix server for the checks to be implemented (straighforward).

I will try to upload some snapshots if possible from the zabbix UI
